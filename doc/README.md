## UML Diagrams ##
UML diagrams of MPCPy may be generated using the code in [PlantUMLs.txt](https://github.com/lbl-srg/MPCPy/blob/master/doc/uml/PlantUMLs.txt).  The UML diagram for a single module is defined between the lines @startuml and @enduml, inclusive.  

Copy and paste the specific code section into the online PlantUML [image generator](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000) and click "submit."
